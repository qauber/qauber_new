== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**How do I use the count-word shortcode?**

There are three ways to count words:

	[sbs_word_count]         // displays word count of current post
	[sbs_word_count id="1"]  // displays word count of post with ID = 1
	[sbs_word_count_all]     // displays word count for all published posts


**How do I use the user-role shortcode?**

There are three ways to display user roles:

	[sbs_roles]                // displays list of roles and number of users
	[sbs_roles role="author"]  // displays number of users for specified role
	[sbs_roles role="all"]     // displays list of roles and number of users
